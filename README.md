Whispers of the Dawn

By the break of morning light,
Soft winds hum a tune so bright.
Golden rays kiss dewdrops fair,
Scattering diamonds in the air.

Birdsong dances, crisp and free,
A melody in harmony.
The world awakens, fresh and new,
A canvas brushed with gentle hues.

Take this moment, breathe it deep,
Let its warmth within you keep.
A whisper of hope, a brand-new start,
A quiet strength within your heart.
