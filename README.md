## Whispers of the Dawn<br />

By the break of morning light,<br />
Soft winds hum a tune so bright.<br />
Golden rays kiss dewdrops fair,<br />
Scattering diamonds in the air.<br />

Birdsong dances, crisp and free,<br />
A melody in harmony.<br />
The world awakens, fresh and new,<br />
A canvas brushed with gentle hues.<br />

Take this moment, breathe it deep,<br />
Let its warmth within you keep.<br />
A whisper of hope, a brand-new start,<br />
A quiet strength within your heart.
